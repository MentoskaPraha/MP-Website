# MP-Website

This is the code for the MP's Official Website, feel free to inspect it and submit changes if you find anything wrong with the code or know how to do something more efficiently.

This website is designed to be hosted on any static deployment platform.

## Deployment

To deploy this website for yourself, simple clone the Github repository and customize the `content.json` file located in:  
`/src/lib/assets/content.json`

Before deploying you will need to install the project dependancies by running the following in your terminal at the project location:

```shh
npm install
```

After you can run the following command to start a local server where your changes are reflected in real time:

```shh
npm run dev
```

Once you are happy with the changes you can run the following to build the project:

```shh
npm run build
```

This will create a folder called build and the files inside this folder can be uploaded to your hosting provider.

> **Make sure to upload the files, not the folder!**
