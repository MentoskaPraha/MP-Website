        Welcome to the About Me page.
        Here you can see all the information you would want to know about me.
        There's nothing too personal though.

            <strong>Little bit about me:</strong><br>
              I’m an amateur programmer and an average gamer.
              I almost always work on websites or API applications,
              but I do occasionally work on games not related to the web in any way.
              I like to play video games with my friends and we most commonly play games like Sea of Thieves,
              Don’t Starve Together, Prison Architect and Satisfactory.
              That’s me in a nutshell, I play video games and I write code.
